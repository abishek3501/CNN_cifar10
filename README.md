# CNN_cifar10
A 6-convolutional layer CNN for classifying the CIFAR-10 dataset using Keras.

Due to low processing power in my laptop, each epoch took an agonising 1.45 hrs. The model is trained only for 15 epochs, which took around 22 hours. :( 

Training accuracy - 90.55% and
Test accuracy - 80.62%

Included relu, dropouts, BatchNormalization and Adam optimizer for faster convergence and training.
